## Exercises for the GirlTechPower coding camp!

#### madlib.py

This is an example program that you can model your very own mad lib program after! Just as in the code, use input functions stored as variables and insert them into your print statements!

Feel free to use your own wild imaginations to come up with your own storylines, but if you would like some inspiration, try [these](https://www.madlibs.com/printables/)!

*Tip: If you have more than one need for, say, a noun, try naming the variables noun, noun1, noun2, etc.*


#### rps.py

This is a program that lets you play rock paper scissors against the computer! The part that handles the random generation on the computer end has already been done, I just expect you to finish the five remaining if-elif statements in the whoWins function. Once you have finished those, finish the code on line 28 to get the user's input, and call generate_hand() on line 31 to finish the program!

Now, if you are up for it, try and use a while loop that keeps the game going until the user wins! *Hint: use the winner variable in the while loop condition*


#### weather_demo.py

This program has had the hard part written for you in the form of the gathering of data, so you can ignore everything above line 15. What I want you to do here is to finish the city and country variables by getting some user input, use them to call getWeather on line 20, and then try and run your code. Hopefully it will display a fancy list (known as a dictionary).

Now that you see how the data comes, uncomment the code written on lines 25, 26, and 27 by removing the pound signs (hashtags). Now try running and see what comes out.

Pretty cool, right!?! If you examine the code, you will see that we access the elements from the dictionary in a similar format to how we access elements in a list, by using the name of the dictionary and enclosing something in square brackets. Where a dict differs though, is that we can use a string to find the value that we want. That string is called the *key*, and whatever value that it is attached to is called the *value*.

After examining this code, I would like you to write a single line that uses the "feels_like" key to get its value.

### Closing thoughts

I just want to apologize for not being able to show you all this live, but I hope that these helped you get a good grasp on Python and all of its possible uses, and that you can walk away from this camp having learned something significant, from how to draw with code to the fact that computer science may not be the field for you.

It has been a pleasure meeting all of you, and if you ever have any questions, please do not hesitate to email me personally at jax944@pm.me

Have a great school year!
